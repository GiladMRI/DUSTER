# DUSTER
MRI DCE analysis
------------------
![Banner](/docs/Banner1.png)
------------------
# Installation
Just download and put somewhere.
The code is all MATLAB, so should be platform independent. Tested on Ubuntu with MATLAB 2018-19.
# Run
Edit /Code/DCE/DCE_Main.m :
Just provide the .nii files: one for the main DCE run, one for T1 map and optionally one for B1<sup>+</sup> map. The files should be already coregistered and aligned/motion corrected.
Also provide:
TimeBetweenDCEVols in secons.
TR in ms.
FA in degrees.

We normally use ~60 volumes at ~6 secons temporal resolution, with TR ~5ms, and FA ~20.
## UIs
The program includes 2 UIs for manual inspection/intervention during the analsys:
1. Arterial voxels selection UI,
2. AIF parameters UI.
And finally, a UI for exploring the results.
Details about the UIs can be found here:

# More inside
## T<sub>1</sub> mapping from VFA-SPGR data
Also included is code for T1 mapping calculation from VFA-SPGR data, using the nominal FAs, and estimation of the real FAs produced by the system.

## 2CXM
In case the termporal resolution is good enough (i.e. volume every <3sec), the 2-compartments-echange-model may be used, providing additional flow information. Code for the analysis, based on [X], is provided here. If you're interested, please contact us.
